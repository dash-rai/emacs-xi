# Xi mode for Emacs

This is major mode for Emacs that provides a way to start up a Xi REPL.

## Installation

Because Xi is still in alpha stage, this mode is not available on MELPA yet.

You will need to download the repository somewhere (suppose `~/emacs-xi`), and
add the following lines to your `.emacs` or `.emacs.d/init.el` files:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs-xi")
    (require 'xi)

## Usage

Enable Xi mode with `M-x xi-mode`.  If you open a file ending with `.xi`
extension, mode will activate automatically.

Then press `C-c C-s` to start Xi REPL.

The default bindings are:

* `C-c C-s`: Start Xi
* `C-c C-q`: Quit Xi
* `C-c C-c`: Run current line
* `C-c C-e` or `C-return`: Run multiple lines
* `C-c C-r`: Run region
* `C-c C-v`: Show output
